# On-device Whisper for dictation

Status: accepted (2026-07-23)

Dictation is transcribed by a local `whisper.cpp` server (multilingual model `small`,
language auto-detect) instead of the browser's Web Speech API the composer used before.
The deciding requirement is mixed German/English speech in one utterance: the Web
Speech API locks a single `lang` per session and mangles code-switched sentences, while
Whisper handles them natively — and it keeps audio on the machine, matching Syflo's
local-first setup (Ollama, SearXNG).

The whisper server is not a permanent resident: the backend spawns it lazily on the
first dictation and kills it after an idle timeout (~10 min). On a 24 GB unified-memory
Mac already under pressure from Ollama vision models, a permanently resident ~500 MB
STT model would buy nothing except a higher swap risk for token generation; the price
of lazy spawning is a ~2–3 s cold start on the first dictation after a pause.

The audio path avoids transcoding entirely: an AudioWorklet taps the getUserMedia
stream the composer already opens for the volume waveform, collects 16 kHz mono PCM,
and the frontend posts it as a WAV to the backend, which relays it to the whisper
server. This removes the second microphone consumer (Web Speech API and the analyser
used to compete for the mic) and keeps ffmpeg out of the stack — rejected:
MediaRecorder (webm/opus) + ffmpeg conversion in the backend.

Rejected: Web Speech API + language toggle (no code-switching, audio leaves the
machine); Node whisper bindings in the backend (native addon makes `npm install`
fragile); a Python `faster-whisper` microservice (a whole new stack for one feature);
Whisper model sizes other than `small` (`base` too error-prone for German, `medium`
too heavy for the RAM budget).
